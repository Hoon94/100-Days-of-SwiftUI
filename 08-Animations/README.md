## 📝 What I Learned

implicit animations, explicit animations, binding animations, multiple animations, gesture animations, transitions, and more.

## 🏆 Challenges

Go back to the [Guess the Flag](../03-Guess%20the%20Flag/) project and add some animation:

> 1. When you tap a flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis.
>
> 2. Make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity.
>
> 3. Add a third effect of your choosing to the two flags the user didn’t choose – maybe make them scale down? Or flip in a different direction? Experiment!
